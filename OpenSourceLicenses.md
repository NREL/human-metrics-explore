This file lists the module dependencies for the project and their licenses.

1. Most of this module code is **not** redistributed, either in source or binary
form. Instead, it is downloaded automatically using package managers and linked
from the code. The module download includes the license and appropriate credit.

1. So our primary check here is for modules which do not have a license, or
which are GPL licensed.
